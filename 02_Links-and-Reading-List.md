### [Defending against evolving identity attack techniques](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/29/defending-against-evolving-identity-attack-techniques/)
Microsoft details how identity-based attacks are evolving, from token theft to MFA fatigue and consent phishing. The post outlines new defenses in Entra ID — including token protection, stronger authentication strengths, and enhanced anomaly detection — to help organizations stay ahead of attackers.

## Password Reuse
### [8 Scary Statistics about the Password Reuse Problem](https://www.enzoic.com/blog/8-stats-on-password-reuse/)
Passwords are still the weakest link in the security chain. While organizations often neglect tools that detect and block compromised credentials, users continue to reuse the same few passwords across dozens of accounts. That habit is putting personal and corporate data in jeopardy.

### [50+ Password Statistics & Trends to Know in 2024](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/password-statistics-trends)
Whether passwords are personal or professional, users tend to follow the same (bad) habits — and utilize a lot of the same passwords. These are some of the emerging and recurring password trends and statistics so far this year.

## InfoStealer Malware
### [Infostealers fueled cyberattacks and snagged 2.1B credentials last year](https://cyberscoop.com/infostealers-cybercrime-surged-2024-flashpoint/)
Cybercriminals used information-stealing malware to a devastating effect last year, capturing sensitive data that fueled ransomware, breaches and attacks targeting supply chains and critical infrastructure, according to a new report.

### [Lumma Stealer: Breaking down the delivery techniques and capabilities of a prolific infostealer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/21/lumma-stealer-breaking-down-the-delivery-techniques-and-capabilities-of-a-prolific-infostealer/)
Over the past year, Microsoft observed the persistent growth and operational sophistication of Lumma Stealer, an infostealer malware used by multiple financially motivated threat actors to target various industries. Our investigation into Lumma Stealer’s distribution infrastructure reveals a dynamic and resilient ecosystem that spans phishing, malvertising, abuse of trusted platforms, and traffic distribution systems. 

### [Katz and Mouse Game: MaaS Infostealers Adapt to Patched Chrome Defenses](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/katz-and-mouse-game)
Elastic Security Labs breaks down bypass implementations from the infostealer ecosystem’s reaction to Chrome 127's Application-Bound Encryption scheme.

### [Millions of people spied on by malicious browser extensions in Chrome and Edge](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/millions-of-people-spied-on-by-malicious-browser-extensions-in-chrome-and-edge)
Researchers have discovered a campaign that tracked users’ online behavior using 18 browser extensions available in the official Chrome and Edge webstores. The total number of installs is estimated to be over two million.

### [Detecting browser data theft using Windows Event Logs](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/detecting-browser-data-theft-using.html)
This blog describes one set of signals for use by system administrators or endpoint detection agents that should reliably flag any access to the browser’s protected data from another application on the system. By increasing the likelihood of an attack being detected, this changes the calculus for those attackers who might have a strong desire to remain stealthy, and might cause them to rethink carrying out these types of attacks against our users.

## MFA
### [MFA Fatigue Attack](https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/mfa-fatigue-attack)
A multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue attack—also known as MFA Bombing or MFA Spamming—is a social engineering cyberattack strategy. This strategy involves repeatedly pushing second-factor authentication requests to the target victim’s email, phone, or registered devices. The goal is to coerce the victim into confirming their identity via notification, thus authenticating the attacker's attempt at entering their account or device.

## Open Redirects
### [Widespread credential phishing campaign abuses open redirector links](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/08/26/widespread-credential-phishing-campaign-abuses-open-redirector-links/)
Microsoft has been actively tracking a widespread credential phishing campaign using open redirector links. Attackers combine these links with social engineering baits that impersonate well-known productivity tools and services to lure users into clicking.

### [Understanding and Discovering Open Redirect Vulnerabilities](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/understanding-and-discovering-open-redirect-vulnerabilities/)
One of the most common and largely overlooked vulnerabilities by web developers is Open Redirect (also known as "Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards"). A website is vulnerable to Open Redirect when parameter values (the portion of URL after "?") in an HTTP GET request allow for information that will redirect a user to a new website without any validation of the target of redirect.
