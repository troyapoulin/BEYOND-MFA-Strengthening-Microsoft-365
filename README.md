# Beyond MFA: Strengthening Microsoft 365 Security in a Zero Trust World

This repository contains the companion materials, scripts, and references for “Beyond MFA: Strengthening Microsoft 365 Security in a Zero Trust World”, a practical session compiled for the 2025 [CBA](https://www.cbaofga.com/) Cyber Risk Summit, focused on real-world security configurations, conditional access strategies, and identity protection in Microsoft 365 (Entra ID).

The session explores how threat actors target Microsoft 365 environments, how credentials and tokens are compromised, and what controls most organizations overlook. It emphasizes actionable guidance rather than theory, showing how to translate Microsoft’s best practices, CIS benchmarks, and regulatory expectations into real, enforceable policy.

## Included in this repository are:
- **Slide Deck** — full presentation slides with embedded resource links.
- **[Links and Reading List](https://github.com/troyapoulin/BEYOND-MFA-Strengthening-Microsoft-365/blob/main/02_Links-and-Reading-List.md)** — curated Microsoft Learn and community resources for deeper dives into each topic.
- **Reference Guides** — summarized notes on Conditional Access policies, authentication strengths, token protection, and identity risk policies.
- **Scripts and Tools** — PowerShell snippets and third-party utilities for auditing tenant configurations, reviewing Conditional Access policies, and testing authentication flows.

While the material was developed for community banks, the principles apply to any organization that relies on Microsoft 365 as a security boundary. It’s designed to help IT leaders, compliance officers, and administrators strengthen their identity layer, improve detection and response capabilities, and reduce exposure to common misconfigurations.
