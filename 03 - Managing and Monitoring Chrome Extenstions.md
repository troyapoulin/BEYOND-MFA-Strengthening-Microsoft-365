# Managing & Monitoring Chrome Extensions

## Managing Google Chrome with Group Policy

### Get and Install the ADMX Templates
Youâ€™ll need Chrome Enterprise and (maybe depding on server version) Edge ADMX templates:

ðŸ‘‰ CHROME: https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/

ðŸ‘‰ EDGE: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download?cs=2282084340&form=MA13FJ

Copy chrome.admx and chrome.adml (language files) into your Group Policy Central Store:

```
\\yourdomain\SYSVOL\yourdomain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions
```

### Create Your Group Policies
On a domain controller or admin workstation, open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Create or edit a GPO linked to your OU containing your users or computers. You need to manage the settings for both Google Chrome and Edge.  The group policy settings will be located: 

- Google Chrome Policies will be located at: Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Google â†’ Google Chrome â†’ Extensions
- Edge Policies will be located at: Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Microsoft Edge â†’ Extensions

##### 1. Block all extensions by default:
- CHROME: Double-click "Configure extension installation blocklist", Set it to Enabled. In the Options field, enter: *
- EDGE: Double-click "Control which extension cannot be installed", Set it to Enabled. In the Options field, enter: *

This blocks all Chrome and Edge extensions from being installed.

##### 2. Allow only approved extensions
- CHROME: Double-click "Configure extension installation allowlist", Set it to Enabled. In the Options box, add specific extension IDs (comma-separated or one per line) that you want to allow.
- EDGE: Double-click "Allow specific extensions to be installed", Set it to Enabled. In the Options box, add specific extension IDs (comma-separated or one per line) that you want to allow.

(You can find extension IDs from the Chrome Web Store URL:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/<extension-name>/<EXTENSION_ID>)

##### 3. Optional: To force-install key extensions (e.g., password manager, security agent):
- CHROME: Double-click "Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions", Set it to Enabled. In the Options field, enter in the following format: ```<extension_id>;<update_url>```
- EDGE: Double-click "Control which extension are installed silently", Set it to Enabled. In the Options box, add specific extension IDs (comma-separated or one per line) that you want to allow.
