# Managing & Monitoring Chrome Extensions

Unmanaged Chrome settings can quietly undermine securityâ€”especially when users install unapproved extensions, sync passwords, or sign in with personal accounts. This article explains how to lock down Chrome using enterprise policies to block add-ins and password sync, and how to monitor compliance through PowerShell and Windows event logs.

## Managing Google Chrome with Group Policy

### Get and Install the ADMX Templates
Youâ€™ll need Chrome Enterprise and (maybe depding on server version) Edge ADMX templates:

ðŸ‘‰ CHROME: https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/

ðŸ‘‰ EDGE: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download?cs=2282084340&form=MA13FJ

Copy chrome.admx and chrome.adml (language files) into your Group Policy Central Store:

```
\\yourdomain\SYSVOL\yourdomain\Policies\PolicyDefinitions
```

### Create Your Group Policies 
On a domain controller or admin workstation, open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Create or edit a GPO linked to your OU containing your users or computers. You need to manage the settings for both Google Chrome and Edge.  The group policy settings will be located: 

- Google Chrome Policies will be located at: Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Google â†’ Google Chrome â†’ Extensions
- Edge Policies will be located at: Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Microsoft Edge â†’ Extensions

### GPOs For Extension Management
##### 1. Block all extensions by default:
- CHROME: Double-click "Configure extension installation blocklist", Set it to Enabled. In the Options field, enter: *
- EDGE: Double-click "Control which extension cannot be installed", Set it to Enabled. In the Options field, enter: *

This blocks all Chrome and Edge extensions from being installed.

##### 2. Allow only approved extensions
- CHROME: Double-click "Configure extension installation allowlist", Set it to Enabled. In the Options box, add specific extension IDs (comma-separated or one per line) that you want to allow.
- EDGE: Double-click "Allow specific extensions to be installed", Set it to Enabled. In the Options box, add specific extension IDs (comma-separated or one per line) that you want to allow.

(You can find extension IDs from the Chrome Web Store URL:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/<extension-name>/<EXTENSION_ID>)

##### 3. Optional: To force-install key extensions (e.g., password manager, security agent):
- CHROME: Double-click "Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions", Set it to Enabled. In the Options field, enter in the following format: ```<extension_id>;<update_url>```
- EDGE: Double-click "Control which extension are installed silently", Set it to Enabled. In the Options box, add specific extension IDs (comma-separated or one per line) that you want to allow.


### GPOs For Browser Sync Management
- Google Chrome Policies will be located at: Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Google â†’ Sign-in
- Edge Policies will be located at: Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Microsoft Edge â†’ Browser sign-in settings

##### 1. Disable Browser Sign In:
- CHROME: Double-click "BrowserSignin", Set it to a value of 0. 
- EDGE: Double-click "Disable browser sign-in", Set it to Enabled. 

##### 2. Disable Browser Sync:
- CHROME: Double-click "SyncDisabled", Set it to Enabled. 
- EDGE: Double-click "SyncDisabled", Set it to Enabled. 

**Edge Registry Paths**
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge
"BrowserSignin"=dword:00000000
"SyncDisabled"=dword:00000001
```
**Edge Registry Paths**
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome
"BrowserSignin"=dword:00000000
"SyncDisabled"=dword:00000001
```

**Verifying Settings With Powershell**
```powershell
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge" | Select BrowserSignin, SyncDisabled
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome" | Select BrowserSignin, SyncDisabled
```

**NOTE:** You can also monitor sign in logs via Windows Event Logs: Event Viewer â†’ Applications and Services Logs â†’ Microsoft â†’ Windows â†’ User Profile Service
(Watch for new browser profile or account sign-ins.)
